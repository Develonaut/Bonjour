        <p class="heading">What is <em>Bonjour!</em></p>
        <p class="body">Bonjour is a one page website created to practice my skills as a web developer and designer! The goal was to create a simple and interactive web page that was built soley off of HTML and CSS with no funny buisiness.</p>
        <p class="heading p-second">Will <em>Bonjour!</em> Evolve?</p>
        <p class="body">Certainly, this is just the beginning! After I hone my skills a bit more, I would love to come back and integrate some JavaScript and replace all the CSS with some Sass and maybe even incorporate some parallax sliders...let’s not get ahead of selves though. For now it remains a one page website, but who knows maybe later we can flesh it out into something even more!</p>

 <p class="body-intro">Imagine yourself sitting in a park on the Seattle waterfront, a latte and a marionberry scone close at hand. The snowy peaks of the Olympic Mountains shimmer on the far side of Puget Sound, while ferryboats come and go across Elliott Bay. It's a sunny summer day, not a cloud in the sky. It just doesn't get much better than this, unless maybe you take in a 9:30pm summer sunset from the Space Needle or the Olympic Sculpture Park and then head to a brewpub. No wonder people love this town.</p>

    <p class="body-intro">San Francisco's reputation as a rollicking city where almost anything goes dates back to the boom-or-bust days of the California gold rush. It's always been this way: This city is so beautiful, exciting, diverse, and cosmopolitan that you can always find something new to see and do no matter if it's your first or fiftieth visit. Oh, and bring a warm jacket: Bob Hope once remarked that San Francisco is the city of four seasons -- every day.</p>

        <p>During the Depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed. In fact, Business was so good, the city constructed the Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge during the Depression.

        <p>When gold prospectors got gold fever they hightailed it to San Francisco. The port became packed with abandoned ships. With demand to build the city booming, the ships were torn apart and used for banks, businesses, and homes.
