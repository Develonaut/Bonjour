The snowy peaks of the Olympic Mountains shimmer on the far side of Puget Sound, while ferryboats come and go across Elliott Bay. It's a sunny summer day, not a cloud in the sky. It just doesn't get much better than this, unless maybe you take in a 9:30pm summer sunset from the Space Needle or the Olympic Sculpture Park and then head to a brewpub. No wonder people love this town.</li>

It's always been this way: This city is so beautiful, exciting, diverse, and cosmopolitan that you can always find something new to see and do no matter if it's your first or fiftieth visit. Oh, and bring a warm jacket: Bob Hope once remarked that San Francisco is the city of four seasons -- every day.</li>
